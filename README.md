## **Overview**

This project explores the relationship between monthly visitor counts in Hawaiʻi and key water quality indicators on Oʻahu. 
Using data from PacIOOS, the Surfrider Foundation, and the Hawaiʻi DBEDT Tourism Data Warehouse, this analysis examines how human activity may influence coastal ecosystems — including:

- Chlorophyll (μg/L)
- Turbidity (NTU)
- Water Temperature (°F)
- Salinity (PSU)
- Enterococcus (mpn/100mL)

The project includes **data cleaning**, **regression analysis**, and **time-series modeling (SARIMAX)** using Python.
